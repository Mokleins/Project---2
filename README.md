## Project Requirements

- The app should use at least 5 components so it keeps the ccode organize. 
- The web application should have a single page application means one index.html.
- It should be at least 3 client-side routes using React Router.
  - It should include a nav bar or other UI element that allows the users to navigate between routes. 
  - Use RESTful routing conventions where applicable.
- The project should use json-server to create a RESTful API for the backend and make both a GET and POST request to the json server.
  - The form should have form/component.
  - The project should incorporate data from an external API but it is not necessary.
  ## Notes 
    - Avoid Nested data and associations. Focus in the frotend for the project.   
    - Re-rendering the page to display the updated list of the movies should belong to the addMovie function.
- The css should be from scratch, either by using styled components or writing css files and using id/className to style your elements. 
    - You can include UI framework such as React Bootsrap or any other as you prefer.
- Separate repositories: `one for your frontend` and `one for your backend`. It will make the deploy easier. 

## Deploying 

- When the project is completed, there are many ways to deploy the frontend and backend. For the backend, 
if the project has json-server, it will need a service capable of running a nnode.js server. For frontend,
It is recommendable using Netlify. There are many services where you can deploy such as AWS.

## Learning Goals

- How to deploy a webapplication from services such as Heroku or AWS
- Understanding how to be more organize using components in React
- Understanding more client-side routes using React Router
- Using json files and understand more the backend of a website
